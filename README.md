# Health-Insurance-Prediction-Model
This is simple project on Health insurance amount prediction model based on data from Kaggle, which was part of my 1st year, 2nd semester project, made with Simple liner regression and Random Forest Regressor.

# About the model:
The model is trained on the data of `1651277648862_healthinsurance.csv` and it was trained using 2machine learning algorithms:
* Linear Regression Model
* Random Forest Regressor

# Objectives of the project:
* Develop a linear regression model to predict medical insurance costs.
* Evaluate the model's performance: Analyze how well the model captures the relationship between features and costs.
* Identify factors influencing medical insurance costs: Identify variables that significantly impact the predicted costs.

# Methodology:
* Data collection: Obtain a dataset containing relevant medical and insurance information.
* Data pre-processing: Clean, handle missing values, and encode categorical features.
* Feature selection: Identify and select the most relevant features that significantly influence the prediction of medical insurance costs. (Age, Gender, Lifestyle factors(smoking, BMI, etc.), etc.)
* Model training: Train a linear regression model using the processed and selected features.
